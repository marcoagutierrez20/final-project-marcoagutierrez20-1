# Project idea 

Similar to what we have done in class I want to build a library or wiki page on a specific subject. I'm thinking of using an api that I can get a mass amount of information from. I'm looking at the pokemon, startwars or imdb api's. GET request can be made to these apis. From there I would take information from those api's and put them in my database. I'd use the informmation in the database to create the library/wiki page. I'd like to display that information in an orgainzed and creative way. I'd also like to tie togther everything we've learened in class. So i'd also like to implement use of comments or allowing for people to edit the page information. This would demonstrate that not only could I get data and store it in a database and present it, but also manipulate data as well. 

# Goals

- Get data from an api and store it within a database.
- Create an api that will work to move data between my database and front end.
- Create a front end to display that data in a creative way. 
- Allow for data to be added/changed on the front end and make those changes accross the full application. 

# Done

- Site is live via http://pokelib.live/#/
- Overall I did not acomplish all I wanted to do. I don't have a way for data to be edited and chagned accross the application. 
- But I am happy that I was able to build an app and host it online. I hadn't done this before and it was a good learning experience.
